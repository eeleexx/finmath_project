4234498,2019-01-22,Bank Of America's Earnings Pop And Positioning (Podcast),"A bearish article on BAC pointed out that banks are facing a flattening yield curve and slowing economic activity, bad news. Bank of America reported earnings that seemed to confirm these trends, but the stock still popped. What gives? We discuss the ins and outs of the bear thesis and what investors might look for from a bank in today's market."

4236057,2019-01-28,Bank Of America: The Thesis Remains Intact,"Bank Of America reported strong Q4 2018 results that beat top- and bottom-line estimates. Additionally, the bank's results for full-year 2018 were significantly better than for the prior fiscal year. I believe that the investment thesis for Bank Of America is not only still intact, but that it has actually gotten stronger over the last four quarters. Bank Of America is my largest holding and I plan to stay long the stock."
4236345,2019-01-29,Bank Of America Is Back,"Bank of America is a high quality compounder that has been growing earnings at a double digit rate.
         The bank is a top tier U.S bank that treats its shareholders well and focuses on responsible, consistent growth.
         BAC still carries the scar of its huge $16.6 billion fine from 2014, but that's precisely why the opportunity exists."
4242701,2019-02-20,Buffett Loves These 3 Dividend Stocks And So Should You,"Dividend growth stocks have proven to be one of the most effective long-term strategies in history. Thus, it's no surprise that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has 14 of its top holdings in dividend stocks including like AAPL, BAC, and KO (43% of its portfolio). Today, all three companies have clear long-term growth plans and are trading at modest discounts to fair value. That translates into about 10+% long-term total return potential, which should prove superior to the S&P 500 in the coming years. That being said, all three companies face risks investors need to be comfortable with, including a potential recession that might be coming in 2020 or 2021."
4250658,2019-03-23,Bank Of America: An Income Play With A Kicker,"Bank of America should be viewed as an income play because the bank has a healthy dividend and promising dividend growth prospects.

4252054,2019-04-01,Why I Don't Fear An Inverted Yield Curve: Bank Of America Is A Strong Buy,"Bank of America is one of Warren Buffett’s largest holdings, and this is not without good reason. Shares yield over 2%, and the dividend should grow aggressively moving forward. Bank of America has a powerful strategy in place to keep growing its deposit base. Shares are a strong buy with over 30% upside in the next 12 months."
4253194,2019-04-07,Bank Of America Cut To Neutral - Something Important Has Changed,"Two important changes in the operating environment for Bank of America have complicated this stock’s story. Economic uncertainty and my concern about a near-term economic disturbance have replaced a previously strong and clear economic growth outlook. A shift in Federal Reserve monetary policy to a neutral position from previously hawkish, along with a nearly inverted yield curve, are negative factors for BAC. I am downgrading my opinion on the shares to “Neutral” from “Strong Buy” because of these important changes. I anticipate increased volatility and downside risk near-term, but I also see the economic backdrop for the shares improving later this year."
4253555,2019-04-09,Bank Of America: Why You Should Stay Away,
4253967,2019-04-11,Crash Protection For Bank Of America,"Two recent articles on Bank of America have expressed similar concerns about it going forward: the potential end of tailwinds from the Fed and the current economic expansion.

I explain why I think the hedge with the negative cost makes more sense at this point."

4254894,2019-04-17,"Bank Of America: Doing OK, But Do You Want To Invest In It?","Bank of America has posted some pretty good numbers in the first quarter of 2019, but investors don't really seem turned on by the bank as an investment opportunity. The current performance appears to have been driven by interest rate increases and continued consumer borrowing, something that may stop if the Fed begins to lower rates. The future vision of the bank seems to be connected with continuing consumer strength, consumer digital technology, and building financial centers - a different model than other large banks are following."
4254882,2019-04-17,Building A Bulletproof Portfolio Around Bank Of America,"Last August, I mentioned how a bulletproof, or hedged, portfolio built around an AT&T position the previous year generated strong performance while strictly limiting risk.

4263438,2019-05-13,Bank Of America: Growth Likely To Moderate From Here,"Bank of America has seen significant moderation in net interest income growth. Moreover, the bank holds a higher proportion of interest-bearing deposits than last year, leaving the bank vulnerable to rate decreases. I do not see too much downside risk for the bank. However, I anticipate that growth will continue in a largely stationary manner for the rest of 2019."
4266667,2019-05-27,Bank Of America: Next Stop $25,Trade war concerns have weighed on stocks lately.

Negative trade war developments and/or slowing growth on the back of new tariffs will hurt Bank of America.
4266623,2019-05-27,Bank Of America Pullback Opportunity Happens Again,"Bank of America’s stock declines again from its previous high peak, due to US-China trade tensions. The stock price is not reacting to fundamental changes in the business model, only to temporary political news. The most recent stock decline offers a leveraged risk/reward opportunity for traders (again)."
4266611,2019-05-28,Stop Worrying About The Yield Curve: Bank Of America Is A Strong Buy,"The flattening yield curve in theory hurts interest margins, but BAC is able to counter with growing deposits and low deposit interest costs. I explain why I believe BAC can continue growing deposits and maintaining their low deposit interest costs. BAC has strengthened their balance sheet which allows them to return all of net income back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. BAC is a strong buy with 25% total return upside in the next 12 months."
4266693,2019-05-28,Why Bank Of America Is Going Higher,"Despite the challenging environment for banks, Bank of America is performing better than most of its peers. The revenue performance has been consistent and solid, while costs have been contained, improving efficiency and EPS. Bank of America stock price is poised to rise in the medium-to-long term."
4267375,2019-05-30,How The Trade War Is Hurting Bank Of America,"The escalation of the trade war between the United States and China increasingly presents risk to the U.S. economy. Bank of America is a cyclical with special exposure to the U.S. economy, and so its exaggerated declines versus the market are appropriate. The forward economic outlook is more important for the shares of this cyclical stock than its current economic environment and will determine the stock’s appropriate value."
4268452,2019-06-05,Catalysts For Bank Of America's Rally,"Bank of America is generating profits and attracting new clients, loans, and deposits despite the challenging market. Bank of America is well positioned with plenty of cash to lend out when the trade war fears. In this article, I break down how the growth in lending is leading to consistent profits and why the stock is ultimately going higher."
4271036,2019-06-19,Bank Of America: The Reason To Stay Long The Stock,"Bank of America pays a below-average dividend, but investors should expect for this to change in the near future. There are plenty of reasons to own BAC shares today, but, if you ask me, the bank's dividend growth potential is #1 on that list. I am long Bank of America, and I plan to stay long the stock."
4271310,2019-06-20,Bank Of America: Expect A 30% Dividend Hike Following Its 2019 CCAR,"Bank of America’s 2018 CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) was a disappointment, in our view. For the 2019 DFAST (Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests), we expect Bank of America's hypothetical stressed CET1 minimum ratio to be slightly below the 2018 DFAST level. Still, it will be a good DFAST outcome, in our view, which will allow the bank to raise dividends. We expect a 30% DPS hike from Bank of America."
4271762,2019-06-24,Bank Of America: Investors Need To Be Really Careful Now,"Bank of America shareholders will likely have to face decreasing forward returns. This week's change in Fed policy is a major negative for U.S. banks, including Bank of America. Interest rate cuts as early as next month point to decreasing NII. Lower interest rates also point to a U.S. recession. I expect Bank of America to lower its NII outlook in its second-quarter earnings release which could be another negative catalyst for the bank's stock price."
4272832,2019-06-30,Bank Of America Corp.: A New Low Yield Preferred Stock You Might Consider Buying,"What are the key metrics of the new preferred stock, BAC-M. A brief look at the company. BAC-M rewards 1.00% more than the maximum you could realize if you choose second highest yielder of the company. In the context of the sector comparison, it is the preferred stock with the highest YTW. The new IPO is well above the 'BBB- rated preferred stocks' Yield curve."

4275739,2019-07-18,Bank Of America Portfolio: Halftime Report,"In April, I presented a bulletproof, or hedged, portfolio around a position in Bank of America.

So far, it is up 2.84%, within 27 basis points of SPY, despite being hedged against a greater than 16% decline."
4276411,2019-07-22,Bank Of America: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy,Bank of America released Q2-2019 earnings last week. Bank of America's net interest income expectedly declined yet again. Rate cuts will negatively affect Bank of America's NII trajectory. Investors should closely monitor the bank's asset quality going forward.
4276395,2019-07-22,Investors Should Just Keep Banking On Bank Of America,"Bank of America reported Q2 2019 results that beat the consensus bottom-line estimate. Additionally, the bank's operating results were impressive almost across the board. The interest rate environment is (and has been) a headwind, but I believe that investors should just keep banking on Bank of America as a long-term investment. Bank of America is my largest position, and I plan to stay long the stock."
4283828,2019-08-09,Bank Of America's Stock May Be Heading For A World Of Pain,Bank of America's stock may be heading lower based on options betting. Interest rate spreads continue to contract. The technical chart is very weak.
4286098,2019-08-15,Selling Bank Of America - A Great Company Can Present A Poor Stock Investment At Times,"I am downgrading Bank of America shares to """"Sell"""" from """"Neutral"""" on its cyclical sensitivity to the economic outlook and likely Fed rate cuts on trade policy disruption. Bank of America's last earnings report showed growth above analysts' expectations. However, the shares are likely to take their lead now from forward risks relative to macro factors to which the cyclical bank is especially sensitive."
4288618,2019-08-29,Bank Of America - This Stock Will Be An Alpha Beast Again,
4290484,2019-09-09,Bank Of America: Shares Will Trade Higher As Soon As Wall Street Gets The Bad Taste Out Of Its Mouth,"There is a massive disconnect between Bank of America’s stock price and its intrinsic value. This is largely due to concerns about falling interest rates and global economic growth, as well as the continued general dislike of bank stocks. Eventually BAC will trade a lot higher."
4290752,2019-09-10,Rising Yields Are Helping Bank Of America,Rising yields are helping the bank's stock. The valuations are compelling. The stock is seeing bullish momentum.
4291660,2019-09-16,Bank Of America Well-Positioned To Withstand Near-Term Challenging Environment - Growing Dividends At 20%,Bank of America's stock was punished in December and has lagged the broader market due to pressures from an inverted yield curve and lower net interest income. It has industry-leading Wealth Management profit margins and an industry-leading effort to rationalize and digitize branches. Management is intent on returning capital to shareholders and making the dividend more competitive with its closest peers. This should drive 20% dividend growth.
4292809,2019-09-21,Bank Of America Corp.: Second Low Yield Preferred Stock IPO In 3 Months,"Overview of Bank of America's new preferred stock - BAC-N. A brief look at the company.

4293784,2019-09-26,Bank Of America: Still My Second Pick In The Banking Space,"Were I to make bets on specific players relative to the overall banking space, I think Bank of America would be a good name to consider. Supporting my mildly bullish position is the bank's solid balance sheet and a better-balanced business model. I believe BAC could be a good """"middle-of-the-road"""" option for investors looking for a bit more high-quality bargain in the banking space."
4293678,2019-09-27,Doubling Down On Bank Of America Dividends For 14% To 18% Yields,
4294868,2019-10-03,Bank Of America: 10-12% Annual Return On Long-Term U.S. Growth,"We like large U.S. banks, because they are natural “GDP+” businesses whose earnings grow ahead of GDP over time. Bank of America is a good example, having demonstrated mid-single-digit core loan growth, rising Net Interest Yield and expanding profit margins. Even on the new, lower rates outlook, it can maintain current earnings - with a small yield decline offset by loan growth and flat/down expenses. At $27.84, Bank of America is the second cheapest among large U.S. banks in P/E terms, and only 0.7x more expensive than Citi. We believe it offers the best risk/reward among large U.S. banks, with a likely 10-12% annual return. Our recommendation is Buy."
4296100,2019-10-11,Bank Of America Leads Financials Lower,"US Banks are inefficient, overweight, and in major need of repair.
         If the US Banking system was more high tech Crypto would not exist.
         Bank of America sticks out as a major loser in the sector, but not the only one."
4296514,2019-10-14,Bank Of America: Priced For A Bad Quarter,BoA is poised to beat quarterly analyst estimates of $0.68. The market is overlooking normal leverage and the current 11% share reduction plan via a $30 billion share buyback plan. The large bank stock trades below 10x EPS estimates that the company normally beats by up to $0.04 per quarter.
4297112,2019-10-17,"Bank Of America Stands Out, Lays Concerns To Rest","Armed with a strong earnings report, Bank of America has eased my near-term concerns about the financial services space. While consumer banking was already expected to perform well, I was impressed by solid execution on the institutional side. In the context of a balanced portfolio that holds stocks across all sectors, I believe BAC is a name worth considering."

4303091,2019-11-06,Bank Of America Continues To Perform,Bank of America reported an excellent quarter despite declining interest rates. The continued  capital return program should produce solid shareholder returns in the long run. Bank of America trades at an attractive valuation relative to the market. The company will continue to outperform most other banks and deserves a premium for doing so.
4304427,2019-11-08,3 Reasons Why Bank Of America Is A Best-Of-Breed Bank,"Bank of America Corporation is one of those best-of-breed banks despite a challenging yield curve. BofA's net interest yield has held up fairly against the backdrop of Fed rate cuts, a trade war, and slower economic growth. I believe Bank of America is in a great position to outperform the market in the medium- to long-term, although there might be short-term pain."
4309163,2019-11-26,Bank Of America: What You Must Be Aware Of,"BAC stock has oscillated with volatility in the last year but is quietly hitting yearly highs. We believe lower rates have made an impact already, as evidenced by the recent Q3 report. There are several metrics you absolutely must focus on. We like the stock long term and give our early 2020 projections for top and bottom line performance."
4310481,2019-12-04,Bank Of America: Hot Stock May Be Ready To Cool,Bank of America has risen sharply in recent months. Options betting suggest shares are due to for a year-end fade. The stock may fall by as much as 5%.
4311160,2019-12-06,"Bank Of America: Forget About 'Peak Payout', 10% Yield Is Sustainable","Bank of America's dominant deposit franchise gives it access to cheap funding and is enabling it to move down the risk curve on lending. Consequently, while its balance sheet is growing quickly, it paradoxically needs less regulatory capital, a phenomenon setting it apart from peers. The company already has $24bn of excess capital and further risk reduction will probably add another $6bn in coming years. As this excess is returned to shareholders and BAC continues to pay out 100% of profits, this year's $37bn CCAR payout authorization looks less like a blip and more like the trend. My numbers show payouts should exceed $30bn p.a. for the foreseeable future, meaning the stock will continue to yield >10%. That's a level any serious income investor ignores at his or her peril."

4312813,2019-12-16,Bank Of America: The Tank Is Getting Dry,BAC's generation of operating leverage has petered out. Valuation is fuller after the recent run. Total returns in prospect are now below double digits.
4313731,2019-12-22,Bank Of America - Top Pick Into Earnings,"Fourth-quarter earnings for the US banking majors are only a few of weeks away, so it's time to start thinking about stock positioning. I expect net interest momentum and performance in investment banking to be the two key issues. BAC looks well positioned on both counts. It has given the most upbeat IB guidance, it has the most resilient margins in recent quarters and it most exposed to buoyant 4Q mortgage volume trends. BAC beat estimates by 10% last quarter, which has pushed the shares 20% higher since October. As repeat for 4Q is probably too much to hope for but a good set of numbers, combined with the prospect of continued big share repurchases, would set the shares up nicely for 2020."
4314921,2020-01-02,Bank Of America: Digital Delusions,BAC's core operations are healthy but growing only slowly. Digital banking progress has been impressive but has not translated into bottom line dynamism. I am skeptical that medium to long term operating margins at BAC will expand strongly due to its digital strategy. Here it is a play on rates.
4315091,2020-01-03,Bank Of America: Stick With This Bank In 2020,"Bank of America's stock outperformed the broader market by a wide margin in 2019. The investment community is concerned about how the interest rate environment will negatively impact the banks in 2020 but, in my opinion, the concern is overblown. I plan to stay overweight Bank of America through at least 2020."
4316516,2020-01-13,Bank Of America May Surge Following Quarterly Results,"The bar for Bank of America appears to be low going into fourth quarter results.

4316655,2020-01-14,Key Earnings Drivers For Bank Of America: Q4 And 2020,"Bank stocks are rallying, but investors need to watch the 2-10 Year Treasury as it will drive NIM growth in the coming months. Although net interest income might take a hit in Q4, Bank of America's trading income should perform well. Also, any geopolitical developments and dovish response by the Fed will likely drive yields in the first half of 2020."
4317670,2020-01-17,Bank Of America Reports Ahead Of Consensus; ROTE Progress To Be The Upside Catalyst,"Bank of America (BAC) beat street expectations for EPS by 9%; however, revenues witnessed weakness in the consumer segment from margin pressures. Continued business investments including technology and employee costs led to some slippages on the cost front. Asset quality is still benign and top-class. Given the solid capital position, BAC is likely to continue the share repurchases, but probably at a lower level in 2020-21. The stock looks fairly valued, with a bit of downside bias, but keep watching the progress on the ROTE front as an upside catalyst."

4318078,2020-01-21,Bank Of America: Reiterate Buy Post Q4; 8-10% Annual Return,"Bank of America shares have returned 25.4% in the 3 months since we initiated our Buy rating, nearly twice the return from the S&P 500. 19Q4 results last week showed Net Interest Revenues being impacted by recent rate cuts, but Non-Interest Revenues and expenses remain solid. While the impact from rates will continue in H1, medium-term earnings will be stable from loan growth, Non-Interest Revenues and cost control. We expect Bank of America's Net Income to grow at 0-2% p.a. and, helped by buybacks, its EPS to grow at 6-8% p.a. At $34.71, the shares offer a 2% dividend yield and an 8-10% average annual return, and represent our preferred U.S. bank stock. Buy."
4318066,2020-01-21,Bank Of America: Don't Let Q4 Distract From The Bigger Picture,"Bank of America didn't deliver as much as hoped-for in 4Q but quarterly numbers aren't the issue for this company. The bigger picture is capital redistribution and that story is still well on track with BAC paying out $34bn in 2019 and retiring 10% of its shares. There's another $15bn of repurchases coming in the next two quarters (5% of market cap.), which will support the stock. Longer term, 2020 CCAR in June is a key catalyst where I expect another big repurchase and dividend authorization that will keep the payout yield above 10%. I'm looking at a price target above $40, indicating there's another 20% upside in the stock. Stay bullish."
4319656,2020-01-28,Bank Of America: Paid To Wait,"BoA beat Q4 analyst estimates despite a dip in net income. The large bank saw a dip in leverage and a higher efficiency ratio. The stock still trades at 10x forward EPS estimates, while the current 10% share reduction plan provides substantial support for EPS growth. The bank could easily double the dividend and pay investors to wait for a rally."

4328761,2020-03-02,Market Correction Causes Buying Opportunity For Bank Of America,"Bank of America’s stock declined strongly, in line with the general stock market decline. The stock price is not reacting to fundamental changes in the business model, only to Coronavirus fears. Earnings growth is still solid and the forward P/E ratio is back in the single digits. The most recent stock decline offers a leveraged risk/reward opportunity for traders (once again)."

4335474,2020-04-01,Bank Of America: Why Skepticism And Increased Rates Will Continue To Push Share Price Lower,"Toughening of loan approval standards by the Bank of America to loyal multinational businesses such as Airbnb will work against the lender. Despite the optimism by Equifax, banks seem to be creating a bearish sentiment especially in the retail market for the next 1 year. If American banks borrow a page from the UK's CBIL, then they will increase interest rates in rolling out the stimulus package by the Fed. Rejection of business credit is the leading contributor to the high unemployment rate that reached a 2.5-year high at 281,000."

         Like other banks, BoA is socking away reserves; the bank's capital looks adequate for now, but uncertainty remains the key word today.

We recommend scaling into the name as a long-term investment. With so many out of work, and businesses closed, loan losses are likely, and the bank has had to react to this reality. Processing Paycheck Protection Program loans creates a new customer relationship dynamic. Large reserve builds weigh, and handicapping earnings is difficult in this market, but we see the dividend as secure and the economy improving in late 2020."
4338571,2020-04-20,Bank Of America: Deep Value With The Largest Dividend Yield In Years,BoA managed to beat Q1 revenue estimates while still generating $4.5 billion in pre-tax income.

The bank recently reported Q1 2020 results and, as expected, earnings were under pressure due to the impact that COVID-19 has had on the economy. In a broader context, many experts believe that we are already in a recession, which will likely have a negative impact on the bank's stock in the near term. However, I believe that it will be a different story for Bank of America this time around - the bank is better positioned today than it was before the last recession (i.e., the global financial crisis of 2008/2009). I'm long Bank of America, and I have no plans to reduce my overweight position in the near future."

4359067,2020-07-17,Bank Of America Still Undervalued As It Invests Through The Downturn,"Bank of America beat on an adjusted operating basis but most of the beat came from lower taxes, as pre-provision profits were only a bit better than expected. The bank will probably need to boost its reserves a little further, but credit quality isn't an issue yet. The asset sensitivity of this bank is a near-term issue, as is management's decision to invest in the long-term growth of the business, but both should pay off over time. Bank of America is meaningfully undervalued on a long-term basis, but near-term outperformance may be more challenging given the nature of the bank's business."

4359051,2020-07-17,Bank Of America Can Withstand The Storm,BAC posted a weak 2Q bottom line but its improvements since the last crisis were also on show. The bank has extensive capacity to absorb losses and a weaker than normal bottom line until 2021 is in the price. BAC remains solid and there is upside if the economy improves. Investors need to be prepared for volatility. Other big banks are cheaper but BAC holders will sit tight.

The company has a proven track record and a much better business structure and balance sheet compared to 2009.

4360110,2020-07-23,Bank Of America Stares Confidently Into The Abyss,"Bank of America was very clear-eyed about the challenges facing them and everyone else, but they exuded confidence in their earnings call. They have raised their loan-loss provisions, and have backup excess capital, but still may have under-provisioned for consumer loans if things get very bad. Bank of America’s quarter gives us a great window into how well policy worked in Q2. But the time we bought with all that cash was wasted."

4373140,2020-09-08,Bank Of America's Relative Position Is Stronger Than You Might Think,"The global economy shows continued potential for volatility, and income-focused investors are looking for stocks that provide additional dividend protection to safeguard against a downward correction in equities valuations. Bank of America has not yet overcome its pre-COVID-19 highs (even though this has already occurred in the S&P 500), and income investors might be shunning the stock. However, Bank of America's price-to-book ratio is resting in a favorable position and this suggests that BAC is actually an undervalued stock at current levels. Ultimately, our valuation analysis suggests that Bank of America could be in a stronger relative position than many of those investors might think."
4375886,2020-09-23,Selloff Pushes Bank Of America Into 'Buy Zone',"Broad declines have characterized the financial sector for most of the year and Bank of America Corp. has lost 11.9% since August 11, 2020. Perhaps these trends are not surprising because analysts now expect U.S. interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time. However, this also means that income investors must take a more defensive stance when adding exposure to stocks in the financial sector. Despite the recent declines in share prices, we believe that the relative position of Bank of America remains strong and its 2.94% dividend yield still looks attractive for bullish investors."
4376947,2020-09-30,Bank Of America Can Still Decline Like Every Other Bank,"Bank of America has suffered on loan default fears during the coronavirus pandemic recession.

4379196,2020-10-15,Bank Of America: On The Buy Radar,"BAC is not as cheap as Citi or Wells Fargo, but it got cheaper yesterday. The market didn't like the 3Q results, but the bank expects improvement in 4Q. Credit risk and capital metrics showed BAC is withstanding the Covid storm well, and this might help valuation in the future. Further significant share price weakness will make it a buy."
4379185,2020-10-15,Bank Of America: Perfection Not Needed,"BoA didn't have a perfect Q3, but the bank generated nearly $5 billion in profits. The bank predicted being done with reserve builds, as nonperforming loans remain minimal. The stock remains cheap at 1.2x TBV and a 3% dividend yield."
4379398,2020-10-16,Bank Of America: This Could Be A Problem,"On a YTD basis, shares of Bank of America Corp. have experienced declines of more than -30%, which is roughly in line with financial sector performances in 2020. However, the bank displayed critical weaknesses in several important areas in its latest earnings report, and this suggests BAC could face difficulties over the next few months. We plan to stay long BAC while share prices are able to maintain support in the lower $20s and price/book valuations remain at favorable levels within the sector."

While interest rates remain low, the potential for an inflation comeback could cause an upward reversal in the rates. I see BofA as trading at the low end of economic cyclicality and believe now is a great buying opportunity."
4379905,2020-10-20,Bank Of America: Worth The Wait,"Bank of America's stock has significantly underperformed the broader market so far in 2020. The bank reported Q3 2020 results that were not well-received by the market. However, I believe that investors will be rewarded for holding onto their BAC shares. I'm long Bank of America, and I have no plans to reduce my stake in the near future."

However, these events have also opened the door for sustained differences in U.S. economic policy that have the potential impact on the banking industry in a very direct (and negative) way. At current price valuations, Bank of America still offers income investors a strong dividend yield of 2.96%, but recent declines in share prices indicate the emergence of slowing momentum. We are currently watching support levels near $22.40 (which marks the low from July 9th, 2020), and a downside break here targets a re-rest of the May 14th lows near $20.10."
4388216,2020-11-12,Bank Of America: A Contrarian Bet For The Long Haul,"Earnings season was not generous with the banking sector, but investors may still be able to find an underappreciated gem like Bank of America. To be fair, the bank's consumer business is suffering at least as much as any of its peers', although the corporate segment has been doing better. Investors that bought BAC within three years after the last recession fared well through 2019. The same could happen over the next decade."

4392078,2020-11-30,Bank Of America Is Recovering From COVID-19,Bank of America has risen 62% since the COVID-19 low. Lower interest rates and credit provisions are (temporarily) hurting the earnings.

         We are back in the future to 2015 with short-term interest rates flirting with the lower zero bound once again.
         Interest rates matter a lot to banks but the longer-term value of the franchise is enticing.
         BAC is very much levered to the reflation trade.

4397027,2021-01-03,Bank Of America: Buffett's Favorite Bank Stock Is 'So-So' In 2021,"Warren Buffett is bullish on Bank of America's stock, as he increased his position by about $2.1 billion this year. That's a major vote of confidence in BofA, as Buffett has otherwise been trimming bank stocks. The current low interest rates put a damper on BofA's core profit margins. In this article, I develop the thesis that Bank of America's stock is an """"OK"""" value in 2021, despite the very real risks it faces."
4398109,2021-01-10,Sell Bank Of America,"Since we made our bullish trading call on Bank of America just three months ago, the stock has seen gains of nearly 45%. However, we think that the recent rally might be running out of steam and this activity represents an excellent opportunity to take profits ahead of upcoming event risks. If quarterly earnings figures are disappointing (once again), investors risk surrendering prior gains in the event that BAC breaks support (near $28.10) and losses begin to accelerate."
4398554,2021-01-12,Citigroup Or Bank Of America In 2021: Stay The Course With Citi Unless Rates Rise,Interest rates matter a lot to banks. BAC is exceptionally sensitive to interest rates.

4398883,2021-01-14,What To Expect From Bank Of America,"The macro environment for Bank of America has improved a lot over the last six months. Shares have risen, but are not really expensive yet.

Net interest income has stabilized and will start growing; credit losses have remained limited, and $0.8bn of reserves were released in Q4. With OpEx expected to be flat in 2021, we believe earnings will rebound substantially and return on tangible common equity will be near 11%. Shares are trading at 1.6x tangible book. We believe long-term return on tangible common equity to be 13%, implying a reasonable 12x P/E. At $32.77, BAC shares are expected to deliver a 42% total return by 2024 year-end (9.8% annualized, including a 2%+ Dividend Yield). Buy."
4400484,2021-01-25,Bank Of America: Buy When Others Fear The Impact Of Low Rates,BAC profitability has taken a hit due to low interest rates. Net interest income is down by an annualised $8 billion. BAC has several offsets but these will take time to play out. The upshot is that BAC is massively over-capitalised and set to benefit from loan loss provision reversals. The time to buy BAC is when rates are low.
4403376,2021-02-04,Higher Rates Can Drive Bank Of America's Stock Up,The yield curve has steepened dramatically over the past six months. This is helping to push Bank of America's stock up. Bullish options betting and technical chart suggest as much as 10% upside.

BAC has strong quantitative ratings - standing out on growth and profitability characteristics, superior dividend grades, strong fundamentals, and its burgeoning growth resulting from early investments in ESG-related businesses. BAC has played a leadership role in the rapid expansion of the green bond market, issuing its fifth corporate green bond of $2 billion in aggregate principal amount. President Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package is rich in ESG initiatives that will benefit BAC. Quantitatively, Bank of America is ranked first in both the diversified banks industry and the financial sector."

My final overall rating is neutral.
4415361,2021-03-22,Why You Should Own Bank Of America In An Income Portfolio,BAC is a core holding of my income portfolio. Both short and long-term rates matter a lot to banks.

4417644,2021-04-05,Bank Of America Still Has Room To Rise,Rising interest rates sustain the rally in market value. The bank is strongly positioned to grow in a post-Covid era. Call options offer the opportunity to make a leveraged bet on Bank of America.

Prospects for strong economic growth and a steepening yield curve are especially good for BAC which tilts heavily toward retail banking and is leveraged to the economy. BAC has outstanding management, led by Brian Moynihan, controls costs carefully, and has done well in the daunting environment of low economic growth and low rates, both now receding. BAC has paid out as much as 100% of profits in buybacks and dividends, which have increased rapidly since 2014, a rate of 29% annually over the past five years. Under CEO Moynihan, the emphasis is on organic growth along with strong commitment to stakeholder capitalism starting with its employees who were provided outstanding support during the pandemic."

Net Interest Income already grew on an adjusted basis in Q1; management guided to more growth and lower Expenses to come. BAC can still grow its balance sheet and earnings, unlike JPM; we now expect long-term Return on Tangible Common Equity to be 16%. Earnings growth opportunities include higher interest rates, loan growth, investment banking expansion and better Efficiency Ratios. With shares at $39.15, we expect an exit price of $54 and a total return of 51% (12.0% annualized) by 2024. Dividend Yield is 1.8%. Buy."

Wells Fargo Stock: Which Is A Better Buy,"Wells Fargo is bigger than Bank of America in terms of the number of physical banking branches, while BAC is larger than WFC with respect to other key financial metrics. Wells Fargo's FY 2021 earnings outlook is positive with expectations of more credit losses reserves being released and a narrowing of its YoY net interest income decline. BAC's 1Q 2021 results were not well-received, and this could be due to its lower capacity for future reserves release and expectations of higher expenses going forward. Wells Fargo's valuations are more appealing than that of Bank of America based on P/B and P/E multiples."
4430873,2021-05-24,Bank Of America's Run Of Outperformance Fairly Values The Longer-Term Opportunity,"Bank of America is emerging from the pandemic in good shape with respect to capital and credit, and spread/loan demand headwinds should ease as the year goes on. The pandemic accelerated customer acceptance of digital banking, which only plays to Bank of America's strengths in this area, giving the company more opportunities to gain share at attractive economics. The outperformance of BAC shares relative to other mega caps has been a reasonable reaction, but I see less outsized near-term excess return potential now."
4432214,2021-05-31,"Bank Of America: Dull, But In The Right Sector","The valuation of Bank of America is unexciting on momentum and price-multiple ratios.

4439703,2021-07-17,Bank Of America: The Stock Is Worth Holding Through The Uncertainty,"Bank of America's stock has significantly outperformed the broader market so far in 2021, even after factoring in the recent dip. The bank reported Q2 2021 results that were not well-received by the market. However, I believe that investors will be rewarded for holding onto their BAC shares through the uncertainty. We're long Bank of America, and we have no plans to reduce our stake in the near future."

4450410,2021-08-18,Bank Of America Fueled Up And Ready To Go When Rates Cooperate,"Bank of America's second quarter earnings report was a little lackluster, as better than expected loan growth and ongoing progress on credit was offset by a small pre-provision miss. Management continues to sound quite bullish on the economy, and Bank of America remains one of the most rate-sensitive banks out there. Bank of America looks priced for a high single-digit long-term total annual return, which isn't bad, but banks could stagnate for a bit without more momentum in rates."
4450339,2021-08-18,Bank Of America Corporation: Valuation Reassessment And August Financial Dashboard,"I last wrote about Bank of America Corporation in early July 2021, and a few things have changed in the fundamentals since then. This article, therefore, provides an updated assessment of its valuation, and the conclusion is the margin of safety is still thin even though BAC is undoubtedly a great company.

4456984,2021-09-24,Bank Of America And Buffett's 10x Pretax Rule,"This article analyzes Bank of America under the framework of Buffett’s 10x Pretax Rule. The results show that BAC presented an excellent opportunity and offered favorable odds for Buffett when he made his purchases. The results also show that at its current valuation, BAC is at a substantial premium to the 10x pretax rule now. At the end, this article describes a few other banking stocks that are better fit for the 10x pretax rule under their current valuation."
4459358,2021-10-11,Bank Of America Vs. JPMorgan: It's A Close Call,"Bank of America and JPMorgan are the top US large banks; BAC is tilted toward Consumer Banking and JPM toward Corporate, Investment Banking, and high-end Asset/Wealth Management. JPM performed much better in the 2008 crash than BAC, leaving BAC a lower base for all metrics; BAC's stock price has performed worse than JPM since 2007, better recently. Both have great CEOs. BAC's P/E is higher because likely to perform better in a hot economy with high rates and because of potentially larger buybacks. JPM's corporate-oriented businesses and high-end clientele make it the choice for non-interest income and safety in a weaker economy. It's a close call. Buffett seems to prefer Bank of America. I own both, but more of BAC."
4459875,2021-10-14,Bank Of America: Net Yield And Loan Growth Turned The Corner In Q3,"BAC released Q3 2021 results this morning that support our investment case; shares are currently up 2.9% in pre-market trading. Pre-Provision Pre-Tax Profit, which excludes one-off reserve releases, is up 30% from Q2 and up 40% year-on-year, as growth continues. Net Interest Income was up 8.4% from Q2, with both Net Yield and Loans growing for the first time since COVID-19; more should follow. Non-Interest Revenues grew, as BAC had less of a cyclical peak than peers; flat expenses point to future operational leverage. With shares at $43.14, we expect an exit price of $56 and a total return of 41% (11.8% annualized) by 2024. The Dividend Yield is 1.9%. Buy."
4464890,2021-11-03,Where Will Bank Of America Stock Be In 5 Years?,"Bank of America's share price rose by +6% in the past two weeks after the bank reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. In the next five years, BAC should be able to deliver at least a mid-single-digit earnings per share growth on an annualized basis. With regards to its attractiveness as a long-term investment, BAC has dealt with digital disruption threats well, and there is the potential for further valuation re-rating. I raise my rating on Bank of America from Neutral to Bullish."

I think that BAC's stock price can reach $60 in 2022 which translates into a 16.5 times forward FY 2023 P/E, after considering its future EPS growth and ROE. Rate hikes, profitability improvement, and share repurchases are expected to be the key EPS and ROE expansion drivers for Bank of America. I rate Bank of America's shares as a Buy with my $60 price target implying a +39% upside."

4478783,2022-01-10,Bank of America: Do Not Fight The Fed,"Do not fight the Fed. Interest rates are on the way up. BAC appears expensive on some valuation metrics. However, the tailwinds in the next couple of years more than justify its valuation. Mr. Market is underestimating its sensitivity to rising rates as well as loan growth, cost efficiency advantage and capital return capacity. I remain bullish."

BAC is one of the most asset-sensitive banks and is well positioned to grow its balance sheet in the following years. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have favored BAC over WFC, JPM, and GS for a reason, and both hold 14.6% and 39.6% of their total portfolio's assets in BAC, respectively. My fair value estimate using a five-year equally weighted dual valuation method stands at $57 and implies a 22% upside from current share price levels for the medium term."

We’ll look at how stocks can perform in this environment. In 2021, the market rose on low interest rates, government stimulus, and a big rebound in earnings. The breeze from these tailwinds may still blow into the New Year. In 2022, the market may be hyper-sensitive and investors should consider stocks that can weather all storms. We'll look at ten stocks with great investment characteristics. These stocks should benefit in either a rally or market correction.

Loan growth accelerated to 3.4%, with every category growing except Home Equity, and is expected to be high single digits in 2022. Interest income will grow $6.5bn if rates rise 100 bps, while the impact from lower markets and corporate activity should be limited. Expenses grew a modest 2.0% from Q3, and management expects to hold them flat in 2022, allowing strong operational leverage. With shares at $46.44, we expect a total return of 41% (9.4% annualized) by the end of 2025. The Dividend Yield is 1.8%. Buy."

4490605,2022-02-25,Bank Of America Looks Quite Appealing Ahead Of Rate Hikes,"Like many of its peers, Bank of America came up a little short on pre-provision profits in Q4, but the loan growth was quite impressive. Bank of America is ready to leverage its expansive commercial and retail lending operations, and the bank's high level of asset sensitivity should help drive double-digit PPOP growth. With a double-digit prospective annualized return, Bank of America is worth a look today."

This opportunity is created by the discrepancies between accounting earnings and economic earnings, or true owners' earnings."
4491045,2022-02-27,Bank of America: Strong Tailwinds,"BoA is poised to benefit from substantial interest rate hikes by the Fed over the next couple of years. The large bank is already repurchasing up to 7% of the outstanding shares to provide a strong tailwind to EPS growth.

4493977,2022-03-10,Bank Of America: Load Up And Ride Rates Higher,"Down over 20% since the February highs has BAC shares trading at a very intriguing valuation.

4498296,2022-03-29,Bank of America - Buffett-Owned And Still So Cheap,"Warren Buffett is possibly the most """"cloned"""" investor of all time, as investors see his holdings as reliable long-term plays.

Wells Fargo: Which Banking Stock Is The Better Buy?,"Major banks have declined in the recent past, despite the fact that rising rates could be positive for their profitability. Wells Fargo and Bank of America offer comparable dividend yields and generate comparable returns on equity. BAC is the lower-risk pick compared to scandal-ridden WFC, but if things go right at WFC, it could experience more pronounced earnings growth in the coming years."
4502282,2022-04-20,Bank of America: Profits Continued Upwards Trend In Q1 2022,"BAC stock has risen 5.3% in the two days after good Q1 results, though still down 11% year-to-date; we believe this represents a bargain. Excluding one-off reserve releases, profits have been on an upward trend, as BAC is benefiting from both higher rates and economic recovery. Net Interest Income grew 13% year-on-year, thanks to both loan growth and higher net yields; sequential growth is expected to accelerate. Non-Interest Revenues have only fallen modestly from their COVID-boosted levels, and operational leverage is adding to profit growth. With shares at $39.57, we expect a total return of 66% (15.3% annualized) by the end of 2025. The Dividend Yield is 2.1%. Buy."
4506464,2022-05-04,Bank of America: The Worm Has Turned,"Bank of America is down 22% for the quarter and 18% year to date. Nonetheless, I submit the worm has turned and blue skies lie ahead for the bank. Bank of America is one of my top dividend growth securities. The bank has steadily grown the dividend over the past decade. What’s more, the bank is trading at a bargain bin price just off a 52-week low. With an attractive valuation, an excellent dividend growth and total return opportunity presents itself. In the following piece, I make my case."
4506579,2022-05-04,Buy The Decline In Bank of America,"BAC is 24% below the 12-month high from early 2022. Rising interest rates are favorable for this stock. The Wall Street consensus outlook is bullish, with a 12-month price target that is 30% above the current share price. The market-implied outlook (calculated from options prices) is bullish. Selling covered calls can provide high income."

Bank of America made close to $18B in 2020, during nightmarish conditions with global lockdowns and a pandemic. CECL accounting rules are very conservative and front load all expected future credit losses, so it is difficult to envision an environment where the bank would actually lose money."

4518659,2022-06-15,Bank Of America: A Bear Market Buy,"A bear market is the time to buy cyclicals. We take the contrarian view on the American consumer and compare BAC to its competition.

4519861,2022-06-23,Bank of America: Wait For It To Drop More,"Bank of America has a strong efficiency ratio compared to competitors, however other banks are taking actions to close the gap. The bank's return on equity could use some work, therefore management is buying back billions of shares to lower total equity. Although the bank is set to experience growing fundamentals due to rising interest rates, the high multiples may be too much for some to handle."
4520360,2022-06-26,Bank Of America: A Value Trap,Bank of America has pro-cyclical investment characteristics. Bank of America will likely see a spike in net charge-offs in a recession. The bank’s stock is unlike to trade at a premium to book value during if economic prospects falter.
4520600,2022-06-27,A Pair Trade: Bank Of America And Wells Fargo,"Due to the strict rules from regulators regarding the balance sheet, Wells Fargo has not been growing and has thus had more capital to return to shareholders in recent years. Since the Federal Reserve froze Wells Fargo's balance sheet growth in February 2018, the stock has underperformed peers, including Bank of America. With Wells Fargo allocating a larger percentage of its capital return program to share buybacks than Bank of America, we suspect that shares could outperform."

We believe the current discount is appropriate but urge investors to be cautious of an economic recession. We have not observed a bear trap to sustain its near-term bottom. Therefore, BAC remains entrenched in a bearish bias. Given markedly slower profitability growth through FY24 (vs. historical averages), we don't consider BAC undervalued. We rate BAC as a Hold for now. However, we will reassess our rating if we observe significant developments in its price action."

4521840,2022-07-05,The Fed Adds Some Stress For Investors In The Largest Banks,"The Fed's annual stress test came out about as expected on an average basis, but with tougher requirements for money center banks. Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan are facing higher required capital ratios, and this will reduce the capital they can return to shareholders over the next 6-12 months. Smaller regional banks are seeing considerably less change to their capital requirements, and remain well-placed to benefit from healthy loan demand and higher rates. Several money center banks look undervalued, but sentiment will be a challenge until capital-building is complete."

4545682,2022-10-10,Bank of America: Candle In The Wind,A factor analysis implies that Bank of America's stock isn't a risk-off favorite among investors. Valuation metrics provide little faith. A scenario analysis conveys that the stock's likely priced-in. An operational vantage point provides an argument that the bank's segmental performance could pivot. Macroeconomic variables paint a grim picture as the great moderation nears its end.

Net Interest Income is up 24% year-on-year as of Q3, thanks to the Fed’s rate hikes and the resumption of loan growth. Impact of Non-Interest Revenues normalizing from COVID highs should be modest; credit costs should be manageable even in a recession. With shares at $32.26, we expect an exit price of $56 and a total return of 82% (22.5% annualized) by the end of 2025. Buy."
4563731,2022-12-11,Bank of America: Why I Bought The Panic,"Last week Bank of America stock plummeted as yield curve inversion worsened and Blackstone faced a wave of real estate fund redemptions. The 'mood' toward financials was ominous due to several bad-sounding news items coming out at the same time. However Bank of America is doing pretty well this year. Its net interest income grew 24% last quarter, and pre-provision net income grew 10%. I bought the panic in Bank of America shares, mainly because yield curve inversion doesn't hurt banks as much as it used to, and because past experience taught me that banks tend to be great buys during 'panic' events."
4564497,2022-12-14,This Isn't 2008: Bank Of America Trades At 10x Earnings,"The economy is crumbling - right? Bank of America is benefitting from rising interest rates, yet delinquencies and loss rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. The company has essentially reached its target CET1 ratio, giving it flexibility to more aggressively buy back shares. With the stock trading at around 10x earnings, shares are offering compelling value as one waits for multiple expansion."
4564917,2022-12-16,Bank of America: The Market Is Fearful Again - Be Greedy Now,"BAC has fallen steeply since we downgraded it, as it underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. Is the selloff appropriate? At its recent highs, yes, because there was too much optimism over its NII growth that's likely to level off in 2023. Hence, the market has likely focused on whether BAC's current valuation is appropriate for a recession. But, investors need to ask whether the market has priced in a significant recession? We explain why after the recent selloff, we are more constructive over its recovery."

The bank is valued at about 9.4x forward earnings, which is way too cheap given its low-risk business profile and consistent earnings quality. Bank of America's stock dropped 24% last year despite strong business performance, and is poised for a rebound as credit outperforms the draconian assumptions implied in the price."
4569630,2023-01-12,Bank of America: Buffett Sees It As The Best House In A Bad Neighborhood,"Organic growth is missing in most big banks, and buybacks are the major inducement to own them; the large banks are also prone to major mistakes. Buffett knows a lot about financials, including their opacity, but suffered as hidden truths came out on Wells Fargo and whacked every bank except BAC and a little Citi. Politicians love to hate banks as easy targets, spoiling buyback prospects; banks are subtly fighting back by cutting customers that really need money. Sorry, housing industry. Investment banking is down drastically, but overpriced Morgan Stanley looks operationally OK; the big winner should be BAC with its cheap deposits and upscaling of clients. Should be. Watch the BAC Q4 report and earnings call for honesty on buybacks (they don't like to break out employee compensation) and info on NII, NIM, and especially the CET1 ratio."

January 2024 target price is $40.93, a 19% pickup from Jan. 10, with target prices ranging between $32 and $52. Based on insights from CEO Moynihan comments in October and December, I view Bank of America a Strong Buy, up from Buy noted in my September analysis.

BAC stock is too cheap at under 10x forward earnings.

Net interest income, benefiting from rate hikes, grew by 22% in 2022 and is expected to grow another 10% in 2023. The overhead ratio improved and is expected to improve again next year; reserves are now sufficient for a mild recession in 2023. BAC has benefited less from rate rises than JPM and has a lower return on equity, but BAC stock is cheaper at 1.6x versus JPM's 2.0x. With shares at $35.23, we expect a total return of 62% (18.5% annualized) by the end of 2025. The dividend yield is 2.5%. Buy."

4571360,2023-01-21,Bank of America: Steering Confidently Through A Storm,"Bank of America, or BofA, needs to tread through less visibility in its net interest income growth in H1'23, complicated by the need to raise its deposit rates. The Fed and the market have also been squaring off on whether an earlier-than-expected pivot could be on the horizon. Despite that, analysts still expect BofA to post earnings growth in 2023. With BofA confident of avoiding a steep recession, the bank's execution should improve in H2'23 with more visibility."
4573027,2023-01-27,Bank of America: Why Fearmongering From Latest Earnings Is Likely Exaggerated,"Fears of net interest income peaking and delinquencies rising appear to be less of an issue for long-term holders. Investors tend to fight the last war when it comes to recessions and this often has bad consequences on returns. Bank of America appears to be in a very good position to improve its return on equity, without taking too much risk."

In 2022, BofA's net interest yield jumped to 2.22%, an increase of 55 bps as compared to Q4 2021, adding $3.3 billion of incremental NII. The full effects of the 2022 rate increases are likely to materialize only in late 2023/ early 2024, and as rates are likely to rise further in 2023. Anchored on analyst EPS estimates through 2025, I value BAC stock with a residual earnings model and calculate a fair implied share price of approximately $47."
4586314,2023-03-09,Bank Of America: I'm Buying This Panic Too,"Last year I wrote an article about how I """"bought the panic"""" in Bank of America shares after the stock dipped to $29 in Q4. Today there is a similar panic afoot; on Friday the stock fell a shocking 6.2% in one day. This time around, there is more fundamental justification for the selling than there was in Q4: Silicon Valley Bank is struggling, and banks are being pressured to raise CD rates. It looks like there's some potential for margins to get squeezed here, but large banks like BAC enjoy protection. If it fell to $23.30, BAC would be valued similarly to the bottom of the great financial crisis, a level from which it rallied 1,000%."

Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo aren't immune to the impact of higher funding costs, but their liquidity situations are far different than SVB's positioning. SVB's news only adds to the concerns around the banking sector, but well-funded, well-capitalized banks like BAC, JPM, and WFC offer good long-term upside at these levels."
4586801,2023-03-12,"As Banking Stocks Tumble, I Turn To Bank Of America And Toronto-Dominion","Recession fears have weighed on bank stocks in recent months as economic declines generally lead to lower demand for loans and higher default rates.

Big banks might benefit from deposit inflows from smaller banks, as they have sufficient earnings power to raise deposit rates. All this make me cautious on the entire sector, as all banks have large unrealized losses, making liquidity key and a stable deposit base key. A small silver lining: lower interest rates narrow the gap with the deposit base being paid, although the gap is still huge."
4586795,2023-03-12,Bank of America: Brace For Impact,"BAC suffered a steep drop last week, caught in the crossfire from the SIVB collapse. Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman expects more bank runs to happen on Monday, which could lead to financial mayhem. The Fed and the FDIC are in discussion for a government bailout to backstop deposits if more banks fail. Investors must carefully assess the risks of buying BAC now, even though it looks attractive. However, with the battering from last week, we think another buying opportunity is on the line."
4587546,2023-03-15,Bank of America: Love The Crash,"Bank of America has crashed this week with the stock falling below $29 to new yearly lows. The large bank appears to be getting stronger during this crisis with up to $15 billion in new deposits.

The market is fearful about banks and $620bn of """"unrealized losses"""" in their bond portfolios, with Bank of America seen as most at risk. These fears largely stem from a misunderstanding of accounting rules, and a new Fed support program has removed most of the risks. Bank of America has always been able to retain plentiful cheap deposits, and large banks are benefiting from the current crisis. With shares at $28.73, our forecasts indicate investors may double their money by2025 year-end. The Dividend Yield is 3.1%. Buy."

4590414,2023-03-27,Bank of America: A Safe Haven Amidst Banking Turbulence,"Bank of America is perceived as a safe haven for depositors amid the instability of the banking industry. Bank of America is performing well, focusing on innovation and technology, but faces challenges such as bond portfolio losses and legal and regulatory issues. The current crisis is less complex than the 2008 crisis, with stricter rules for healthier banks.

Banks are feeling the effect of a negative Treasury yield curve, causing them to tighten lending standards and reduce credit availability. Bank of America Corporation is currently experiencing a strong bullish trend and presents a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors at strong support level. The appearance of a falling wedge pattern in BAC's stock price suggests a high likelihood of a breakout above key levels."

4595303,2023-04-20,Bank Of America: A Case Of Declining Deposits And Higher Funding Costs,"The recent banking crisis has been interesting to follow, due to the notable impacts on big US banks, notably BAC in this article. The big bank has reported declining deposits QoQ and YoY, despite the increased funding costs, with much of the money likely flowing to money market funds. However, investors may still be encouraged by BAC's improving NII, attributed to the elevated interest rates that may also remain over the next few quarters, before the Fed's potential pivot. Its provision for losses appears decent as well, compared to pre-pandemic levels, with strict FICO scores of over 770 across its loans. Therefore, we remain cautiously confident that BAC remains well positioned to weather the short-term volatilities ahead, due to the exemplary execution thus far."

BAC's shares should recover as it wasn't meaningfully impacted by the banking crisis, but it is unlikely the stock can return to $50 in the near term.

While money market funds will take cash off the balance sheet, the rate environment should keep net interest margins ripping upwards as long as the overall deposit trend is flat. Bank of America is my favorite bank. They've attracted deposits from the Regional Bank attack, which may improve their net interest margins over time.

BofA's deposit-taking capability accounts for approximately 14% of retail deposits and is growing, providing stability and visibility for the bank's lending business. The bank's debt securities portfolio is a cause for concern, but its significant undervaluation relative to its 10-year average presents an opportunity for patient investors.

Analysts predict BAC will report $25.17 billion in revenue and $0.85 in EPS for Q2, which would be a decline from Q1 but positive growth from the prior-year quarter. BAC may beat expectations on revenue due to increased retail sales and healthy mortgage rates but may struggle to meet earnings expectations due to rising PCLs. Despite potential risks such as further interest rate hikes, yield curve inversion, and a possible recession, I believe BAC's stock is currently undervalued and am comfortable holding it ahead of the Q2 earnings release."

4618689,2023-07-22,Bank of America: A $106 Billion Hole Isn't A Problem Until The Fed Says It Is,"While BAC may still report $106B of unrealized losses, it is apparent that the Fed is not overly worried for now, thanks to the robust liquidity and depositors' confidence. Due to the rate hikes, the bank reported expanded NII and NIY, attributed to the increase in its interest-bearing deposits to $1.27T. The higher treasury yields may also herald the return of trading and investing activities in H2'23, with FQ2'23 only temporarily impacted by the US debt ceiling uncertainties. While credit card losses may seem elevated, investors need not fret yet, since the ratio remains well below pre-pandemic averages. With a stable ROTCE performance of 15.5% (-1.9 QoQ/ inline YoY) in FQ2'23, compared to FY2019 levels of 15.8%, we remain confident about BAC's prospects during the uncertain macroeconomic outlook."

The bank faces challenges like declining net interest income due to an inverted yield curve and potential risks related to rising interest rates and economic indicators pointing towards elevated unemployment.

The stock has been affected by concerns about treasury yields and unrealized losses. BAC has a large amount of unrealized treasury losses, but its liquidity is still superior to that of the other Big Four banks - including JPMorgan. If you adjust Bank of America's treasuries down to fair value, they still cover 56.9% of deposits.

The perception of liquidity issues has caused Bank of America stock to underperform, but the bank's liquidity is actually strong. Bank of America's valuation is low compared to its peers, and the bank has shown impressive profitability and growth potential.

""""Mark-to-market"""" valuations have little effect on the bank's business as long as a going concern is assumed and holds the securities to maturity. """"Mark-to-market"""" valuations represent an opportunity cost that the certainty of future profits requires the company in question to give up.

This is despite the sustained expansion in its NIY and RoTCE, implying the bank has been able to generate alpha despite the Fed's sustained rate hike thus far. For now, it appears that Mr. Market is increasingly concerned about BAC's unrealized losses, which we believe to be unwarranted since most of them belong to HTM debt securities. Then again, based on Powell's pessimistic commentaries, it appears that many have adopted a sell first and think later attitude, especially since the US Treasuries Yields continue to climb. As a result of the potential volatility, investors may want to monitor market sentiments for a little longer and only add if the critical support levels of $25s hold through in the near term."

BAC's valuation has normalized significantly, trading at a forward-adjusted P/E of 10.5x. As a result, the best buy levels are likely gone at BAC's cyclical lows in October 2023. BofA anticipates improved NIM dynamics and expects higher rates to continue benefiting its earnings visibility in the medium term. I argue why BAC remains early in its recovery, although the """"best"""" buy levels are likely gone, as I caution in my previous Strong Buy rating. Notwithstanding its remarkable surge from its October lows, investors shouldn't be fooled into getting out this early unless they reallocate to potentially more attractive opportunities."

The bank's growth in deposits and loans is positive, but expenses have increased and the narrowing gap between loan earnings and deposit costs is impacting return on equity.

Speculation of rate cuts by the FED in early 2024 improved investor sentiment, leading to an almost 30% increase in share price since late October 2023. While the bank has a strong economic moat and performed well in its core business segments, the increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs is concerning.

Q1 2024 data leaves a fair price estimate at $47.30, with a $59.66 future target, indicating 36.4% near-term upside and 12% annual returns. BofA plans expansion by opening 37 new financial centers across nine states by 2026. It demonstrates robust financial stability, holding significant cash reserves and a strong market position."

The FDIC Special Assessment had a negative impact on the bank's net income, but preferred dividends remain safe. The Series HH preferred shares have a fixed dividend yield of 5.98% and are currently trading below par. The Series L """"busted"""" preferred shares appear the better choice."

4688999,2024-05-03,Bank of America: Wait For A Better Price,"Bank of America's Q1 2024 results showed negative revenue growth and a decline in net income. The decline in revenues was due to drops in consumer banking and global banking segments. Despite the decline in revenues, BAC is managing its capital and risks adequately, though one of its main peers is doing it better. There are headwinds to face in the near future as more regulations might be implemented, and high-interest rates might be kept longer than expected. I rate the stock as a hold."

The stock currently trades at 1.2x price to book, a relative bargain compared to long term historical price to book valuations. The latest concern about consumer credit card debt may be overblown, as charge off rates are moving in the right direction."

Currently, BAC is exhibiting a trend of lower NII from a year ago, but non-interest income has picked up again, primarily due to higher S&T and IB activities. Charge-offs have been increasing from previous quarters due to higher delinquency rates in credit cards, coupled with the credit crisis in the commercial real estate space. Based on a dovish monetary policy that will likely reduce the cost of funding and a DDM model with an elevated margin of safety, I assign BAC a buy rating."

Bank of America's preferred shares offer a 5.65% yield, but swapping to Series L could provide a higher yield with similar risk. The bank's preferred dividends are well covered, making them an attractive investment option."
4703000,2024-07-08,"Bank of America Should Outperform On Core Growth In '25-'26, But Is That Priced In?","Bank of America has continued to outperform smaller, more spread-dependent banks, and Q2'24 should be the low point for NIM and net interest income. Leveraging past investments into technology, Bank of America should be able to pair slightly above-average revenue growth with above-average operating leverage, driving high single-digit pre-provision growth in '25-'26. Bank of America has opportunities to leverage growth in trading and investment banking that may not be fully appreciated, as well as core consumer growth opportunities in wealth and cards. Core earnings growth of around 4% and mid-teens ROTCE can support a fair value in the low-to-mid-$40's, suggesting that Bank of America shares are priced about where they should be."

Nonetheless, management provided an outlook where they believe Q2 '24 is the NII trough.

4718573,2024-09-03,10 Reasons That Likely Motivated Buffett To Sell Bank of America Stock,"Warren Buffett is selling Bank of America shares, likely due to a potential recession, high valuation, and weakening consumer financial health. Bank of America faces headwinds like increasing credit losses, leverage risks, and lackluster loan growth, making it less attractive. The bank's competitive moat is weakening as digital banking rises, and its valuation is high compared to peers. Buffett prefers redeploying capital to better opportunities, as Bank of America doesn't meet Berkshire Hathaway's ideal high-ROE, growth-focused criteria."
4721093,2024-09-14,Bank of America: Triple Whammy Ahead,"Investing in Bank of America is risky due to rising non-performing real estate loans and upcoming property tax hikes, especially in New York and California. The belief that interest rate reductions will benefit BAC is flawed, given the significant challenges in the commercial real estate sector. The combination of rising property taxes, declining demand for commercial real estate, and potential losses on mortgage-backed securities creates a """"triple whammy"""" for BAC. Investors should closely monitor BAC's upcoming quarterly report for further insights into these troubling trends."
4721358,2024-09-16,Bank of America: Why Valuation Matters,"Bank of America remains a well-managed, well-capitalized, shareholder-friendly institution, making it a relatively safe, long-term investment for conservative investors. In this article, after a brief business recap, we will dive into BAC common stock valuation. I do not believe Warren Buffett's recent sales of BAC shares reflect him seeing a boogeyman.  To the contrary: it's just business."
4721284,2024-09-16,Bank of America: Rising Competition And Limited Upside Potential Make It A Hold,"Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stake in Bank of America by 17%, prompting a reevaluation of the bull thesis. Bank of America has experienced a decline in non-interest bearing deposits across its business segments, indicating a potential weakening of its competitive advantage. JPMorgan has outpaced Bank of America in both overall deposit growth and non-interest bearing deposits, challenging BAC's traditional dominance. Bank of America's aggressive digital banking strategy may have unintended consequences, such as reduced cross-selling opportunities and weakened customer relationships."
4722668,2024-09-23,"Trimming Bank of America Is Good For Buffett, Not Us","Bank of America, a major U.S. bank, is a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, which recently sold 20% of its stake. It follows a similar move by Buffett with AAPL, showing his wish to build up a large cash position. His original investment in BoA, negotiated directly with CEO Brian Moynihan, shows why trimming and raising cash is attractive for BRK. For the average investor, however, BAC shows signs of fair valuation, with modest upside over time little risk given the bank's healthy balance sheet."

4723260,2024-09-25,Bank of America: Revealing Buffett's Likely Selling Motives,"Buffett's recent actions raise questions - why does he keep selling BofA stock? I've decided to approach this question from my unbiased side as I haven't covered BAC before. I see BAC trading at about fair P/E on a forwarding basis (it's even ~4.5% lower compared to the medium-term average multiple). Since the COVID-19 pandemic era, BAC's paper losses have exceeded $110 billion - more than twice the unrealized losses of its main peers (JPM and WFC). The largest portion of the MBS part of BofA's debt portfolio - something over $448 billion - is quite long-dated (due in over 10 years), yielding just 2.12%. BAC's deposit base is eroding rapidly despite the money supply surge in recent years. The bank is losing competition for clients, in my view. It may be the main reason for Buffett's recent sales."
4725910,2024-10-09,Buffett Selling Bank of America Is A Warning,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been selling shares in Bank of America and other long-term holdings, likely an effort to raise cash before a potential bear market. BAC has widely underperformed both the S&P 500 and the financial sector since 2007, including trading over the past year. A subset of technical indicators is highlighting a rare sell signal, suggesting material downside risk, especially in a recession scenario. Limited upside potential matched against the substantial risk of loss lead me to maintain a Sell rating on Bank of America for the next 12 months."
4726177,2024-10-11,Bank of America Q3 Preview: Erica AI To Power Growth,"Despite the stock's decline since the summer and Warren Buffett's share sales, I believe Bank of America's AI investments, particularly Erica, will sustain growth and improve operational efficiency. The Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and BAC's strong consumer spending trends present economic tailwinds, making the current market sentiment overly cautious. Analysts' conservative EPS projections for Q3 may be exceeded due to BofA's AI-driven efficiencies and robust performance in investment banking and capital markets. With my estimate of fair value at a P/E of 17 times earnings, BofA shares have significant upside potential, supported by AI-driven cost savings and strong consumer engagement."

One major positive to BAC is the way the stock absorbed the selling by Berkshire of Hathaway of a substantial part of its Bank of America position. When Citigroup also reports their third quarter ’24 financial results on October 15th, analyst consensus is expecting $1.31 in EPS on $19.8 billion in net revenue for expected y-o-y declines of -14% and -1%, respectively."
4726991,2024-10-15,Bank of America Q3 Earnings: Net Interest Income Finally Rose,"Bank of America reported Q3 earnings with a slight stock increase of 0.55%, surpassing most analyst estimates. The key highlight is that net interest income started seeing a sequential recovery of 2%, despite an EPS decline. After Q3 earnings, the price-to-tangible book valuation became cheaper, so I reiterated my """"buy rating"""" on the stock."
4727060,2024-10-16,Bank of America Q3: Why I Sold Shares After Earnings,"Bank of America released its third quarter earnings Yesterday. The release beat expectations on revenue as well as on earnings per share. Shortly after the release came out, I sold 33% of my shares. Although the earnings were not bad, BAC's valuation had gotten stretched prior to their release. In this article I analyze Bank of America's Q3 earnings and explain why I sold part of my position after they came out."
4727415,2024-10-17,Bank of America: Q3 Points To Upside Breakout (Technical Analysis),"Bank of America reported strong 3Q24 results, driven by higher investment banking fees and trading revenues, despite increased loan losses affecting its credit profile. The bank's net interest income grew QoQ, with a positive outlook for mortgage and auto loans, though YoY growth was impacted by higher deposit costs. Technically, the stock is bullish, breaking above key moving averages, and remains undervalued compared to peers, suggesting potential for further upside. Despite rising credit losses, the robust U.S. economy and job market support a positive investment thesis, with an intrinsic value target of $48-49 per share."
4727631,2024-10-18,Bank of America: Reasonable Value On Upcoming NIM Expansion,"Bank of America stock has been fairly lackluster over the past two years or so, trailing close peer JPMorgan significantly in that time. The bank's net interest margin hasn't quite seen the same degree of upside from higher interest rates, but that should change over the full course of the cycle. Upside to NIM can drive profitability closer to management's goal. At 11x forward EPS estimates, the stock looks like a reasonable value for long-term investors."
4727479,2024-10-19,Bank of America: A 6% Preferred Dividend Yield Remains Attractive,"Bank of America's Q3 results show solid net interest income and well-covered preferred dividends, with a net profit of $6.9B and EPS of $0.816. The bank's CET1 ratio remains stable at 11.8%, despite dividend payments and stock buybacks, indicating strong financial health. The Series GG preferred shares offer a 6% yield but carry an imminent call risk, making them less attractive for new investments. I maintain a small long position in both common and Series GG preferred shares, favoring common shares for potential growth and writing out-of-the-money put options."
4728169,2024-10-22,Bank of America: Buffett Selling Should Not Distract From Preferred Share,"Bank of America’s preferred shares offer attractive fixed dividend yields, especially BAC.PB and BAC.PK, despite loan performance challenges and Warren Buffett selling common shares. The bank’s net interest income remains strong, with loans generating more interest income, although higher interest expenses persist. Bank of America’s loan growth outpaces the commercial banking sector, and they have maintained a low loan to deposit ratio since the pandemic."

Bank of America reported 1% y-o-y net revenue growth which generated -10% EPS growth, which was the 4th straight quarter of y-o-y negative EPS growth. Citi too, like Bank of America, reported y-o-y net revenue and EPS growth of +1% and -1% respectively, and overall ROTCE of 8%."
4729944,2024-10-27,Bank of America: We May Have Already Seen The Top,"Bank of America reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings, with strong trading results and net interest income. Despite solid performance, shares trade above the 3-year average price-to-book ratio, presenting an unattractive risk profile. The bank also faces future earnings growth challenges due to declining federal fund rates. Concerns persist about Berkshire Hathaway selling shares and potential impacts of federal fund rate cuts on net interest margin and earnings. Given the current valuation and economic outlook, I advise against accumulating Bank of America shares at this time."
4735798,2024-11-10,Bank of America: Bull Rally Strength Continues (Technical Analysis)(Rating Upgrade),"Bank of America has shown strong earnings and revenue growth, driven by trading revenues and investment banking fees, despite weaknesses in net interest income. BAC stock is attractively valued compared to peers, with a price-book ratio of 1.202x, but the stock does have a higher forward P/E ratio than important financial peers. Technical analysis suggests the potential for a 17.82% rally to $50.11, supported by key Fibonacci retracement levels and a favorable RSI reading. I raise my rating outlook to a """"buy"""" due to the stock's improving net interest income results and strong potential for further gains in long-term bullish price trends."
4737868,2024-11-15,Bank of America And JPMorgan Chase: Deregulation Tailwinds Ahead,"JPM and BAC have benefited from a sharp rally post-election, both outperforming the average financial sector. I will argue JPM and BAC rallies are far from over given the potential deregulation expected from the upcoming Trump administration. Leading banks like BAC and JPM are especially well-positioned to benefit due to their scale, profitability, and financial strength. Their current P/E ratios admittedly appear elevated, but investors should also examine other valuation metrics (such as dividend yields). All told, some valuation premium is well justified given the potential for sustained growth ahead."
4743639,2024-12-11,Bank of America Is A 'Buy' Despite Seeming Overvaluation,"I believe Bank of America Corporation is poised for growth in 2025 due to a favorable market environment and lower regulation, despite appearing overvalued. Q3 results show solid performance in key segments, with digitalization and AI integration driving future margins and customer growth. BAC's strong balance sheet, prudent capital management, and expected EPS growth make it an attractive investment despite current valuation concerns. The back winds from a rising yield curve and the recovering capital markets environment position BofA to provide better earnings and shareholder returns in future quarters. I don't think BAC stock is as overvalued as many people on the market fear to date. So I initiate a “Buy” rating and expect the stock's rally continuation into 2025."
4743561,2024-12-11,Bank of America: Buy Now For Increased Dividends,"Financial sector thrives in 2024, boosted by a solid economy, lower inflation, and gradual rate cuts, with Bank of America poised to challenge its all-time high. Trump's election victory and potential deregulation are expected to drive further gains for banks, echoing the post-2016 election rally. Bank of America could see significant dividend increases in 2025, potentially reaching $0.30 per share, driven by earnings growth and relaxed capital requirements. I recommend buying BAC now, anticipating continued sector strength and dividend hikes under favorable economic and political conditions in 2025."
4747351,2025-01-02,Bank of America: My Best Bank Idea For 2025,"Bank of America is set for a strong 2025 due to the Fed's higher-for-longer rate environment, boosting net interest income. The U.S. economy's growth and record stock market highs create a favorable backdrop for cyclical bank stocks like Bank of America. Bank of America's Consumer Banking segment thrives with robust deposit growth, positioning it for cyclical profit growth in a growing economy. Despite a 25% premium to book value, Bank of America's strong results and favorable economic conditions make it a top bank investment for 2025."

The Series L preferred shares offer a 6% yield and low conversion risk, making them attractive for income-oriented portfolios. The current market conditions and potential future interest rate cuts make locking in the 6% yield on preferred shares advantageous. I hold a small long position in BAC and prefer BAC.PR.L for better yield visibility and potential capital gains."

AI is expected to significantly reduce costs and boost profits, potentially adding $17.37 billion annually by 2027. Q4 earnings are anticipated to act as a catalyst, showcasing the initial impact of AI cost cuts on the bank's bottom line. Despite inherent risks, I believe AI's efficiency gains are not fully priced into the stock, presenting substantial upside potential for Bank of America shares."
4749146,2025-01-13,Bank of America: A Weaker Consumer Could Weigh On Q4 Earnings,"Bank of America is heavily reliant on the U.S. economy, making it vulnerable to consumer credit deterioration and economic downturns. Despite appearing inexpensive on a Price/Earnings basis, potential credit losses and stalling revenue growth suggest shares may be overvalued. Preferred shares offer a more attractive yield and stability compared to common stock, given current economic uncertainties and potential for higher charge-offs. Bank of America is well-capitalized but faces significant risks from rising unemployment and a potential recession impacting consumer and commercial loans."
4750450,2025-01-19,Bank of America: I Was Wrong About Interest Rates (Rating Upgrade),"Bank of America reported strong Q4 earnings, driven by robust investment banking activity, higher NII and a healthy balance sheet. Bank of America also beat earnings and revenue estimates for Q4'24. The banking giant issued a favorable NII projection for 2025 and sees successive growth in net interest income due to the Fed's supportive rate policy. The Federal Reserve's slower pace of rate cuts in 2025 is expected to benefit Bank of America's net interest income, improving its growth outlook. While the earnings/NII outlook for large banks has improved lately, Bank of America's shares continue to trade at a high valuation factor, relative to the bank's historical P/B ratio."
4751054,2025-01-22,Ignore Buffett And Buy Bank of America (Technical Analysis),"Ignore Warren Buffett's recent sale of Bank of America stock; technicals are bullish, and the stock is undervalued based on P/E and P/B ratios. BofA's chart shows a strong uptrend with multiple support levels and minimal resistance, indicating further gains are likely. Moving averages and Bollinger Bands confirm long-term strength and bullish momentum, despite mixed signals from MACD and stochastics. BofA's impressive revenue and EPS growth justify higher valuation multiples, making the stock a buy for both technical and value investors."

With deposits at a record $1.97 trillion and growing loans, BAC is poised for robust NII growth in 2025. The Company is undervalued relative to Wells Fargo, with a potential intrinsic value of $56 if it re-rates to WFC's book value multiple. Surging business confidence and a higher-for-longer interest rate environment could significantly boost Bank of America's profits, book value, and net interest income in 2025."

4762716,2025-02-27,Bank of America: Share Price Pressure Is Good News For Long-Term Shareholders,"Recent strong performance of Bank of America's share price brought valuation more in line with current business fundamentals. While BAC is closer to fair value at the moment, shareholder returns in 2025 are likely to come under pressure. Excess cash will continue to weigh on returns, but ultimately this is good news for long-term shareholders."
4762667,2025-02-27,Bank of America: The Dip Gives A Nice Opportunity,"I reiterate my """"Buy"""" rating for Bank of America, expecting growth in 2025 due to favorable market conditions and reduced regulation. BAC's strong financials, particularly in Consumer Banking and Global Wealth Management, support its potential for continued growth and margin enhancement. Reduced regulatory pressure under Trump's administration could lower compliance costs and financial penalties, boosting BAC's net income. Despite risks, BAC's strong balance sheet and competitive valuation suggest a potential 10% total return for FY2025."
4770208,2025-03-25,Bank of America: Weak Stock Performance As A Warning,"Bank of America holds substantial exposure to consumer and small business loans, with Warren Buffett selling shares in 2024. A potential recession in 2025, driven by Trump’s stagflation policies and a Wall Street pullback in wealth, could push shares significantly lower. Technical momentum analysis reveals ultra-weak performance, particularly from OBV and EMV calculations, suggesting further downside risk for BAC."
4771831,2025-03-31,Bank of America: Still Fair Price But Braced For Recession,"My previous thesis highlighted Buffett's strategic trimming of Bank of America, suggesting limited upside, but noted BoA's liquidity and resilience during downturns. Current valuation metrics indicate modest upside, with a fair value of $49, but recent buybacks at high prices could hinder long-term EPS growth. I maintain my Hold rating on BAC due to fair valuation and headwinds like tariffs and a possible recession. Despite its strong fundamentals, headwinds suggest long-term investors should wait for a better entry price for improved risk-reward asymmetry."
4772845,2025-04-03,Bank of America: Series L Preferred Shares A Hold After Recent Outperformance,"Bank of America only derived 55% of its 2024 revenues from net interest income, making it less dependent on Fed rate cuts compared to smaller peers. The bank's baseline outlook for 2025 is already quite conservative, indicating no substantial provision build is to be expected when it reports Q1 2025 results. I present three valuation scenarios for the convertible fixed-rate Series L preferred shares. I argue a hold rating is warranted after the Series L preferred shares outperformed peers over the past year. Key risks to consider include no rate cuts from the Fed and a return of credit spreads to levels observed before the COVID-19 pandemic."
4774052,2025-04-09,Bank of America Q1 Earnings Preview: Guidance And The Macro Don't Align,"Bank of America Corporation faces economic uncertainty, with Q1 2025 earnings expected to be impacted by macro pressures and a shift in market sentiment. Despite strong Q4 2024 results, BAC's stock has dropped significantly, underperforming peers like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, raising concerns about its resilience. Management's optimistic NII guidance for 2025 may be overly hopeful given current economic conditions, with potential risks from inflation, tariffs, and consumer credit. I rate BAC stock as a Hold, recommending caution until after the earnings report to avoid non-systematic risk and reassess based on fresh information."
4774520,2025-04-12,Bank of America: An Opportunity In The 6%-Plus Yielding Preferred Shares,"Bank of America's Series GG preferred shares offer a 6.15% yield and are trading at a 2% discount to their $25 call value. Preferred dividends are well covered, requiring just 6% of Bank of America's net income, an improvement from 6.22% in 2023. The Series GG preferred shares present an attractive investment due to their fixed dividend rate and potential for capital gains if called. Considering market volatility, I may write put options on common shares and plan to increase my position in Series GG preferred shares."
4775309,2025-04-15,Wall Street Lunch: Banks Liking These Market Swings,"Banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup are thriving amid market volatility, with strong trading and equity sales driving impressive earnings. Johnson & Johnson shows resilience, while Albertsons struggles with lower-than-expected EPS and sales projections.
